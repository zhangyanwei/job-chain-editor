#### About

It's a web-based UI to write and manage the configurations for [job-chain](https://github.com/zhangyanwei/job-chain).

And it includes two parts, one is the frontend of the editor and another one is for the editor service.

#### How to run it?

It simply includes the two parts (created two folders of them). it means, we have to run it one by one, I'm not sure in the future whether to write some useful tools to make it start easily.

#### Start service

It written base on the Flask framework, so start the service first.

#### Start client

Navigate to the client directory, and configre the dev-server proxy for remote the calls.
